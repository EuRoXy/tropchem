Code for tropospheric chemistry lecture

This repository is populated with jupyter notebooks and python code used in my lecture tropospheric chemistry taught at master level at ETH Zurich

Currently (Aug 2018) it contains the following notebooks:

- unit-conversion-notebook: Two small exercises to convert units of mole fraction to concentration and to number density
- pbl-evolution-notebook: Demo of the influence of PBL mixing on the diurnal cycle of a trace gas in the PBL and in the residual layer
- urban_plume: Demonstrates the formation of ozone in an urban plume using a very simple chemical box model. The emissions of NOx and NMVOCs in the city can be modified to test the sensitivity to these inputs and to generate, for example, an EKMA diagram.
